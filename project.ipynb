The scope of this analysis isn’t deep enough to find whether the correlation is caused by a hidden variable. For this reason, we wanted to include current smoking among adults in the results, since at least in within the scope of our data it seemed to negatively correlate with air pollution levels, and as a known predictor for cancer it could partially explain the result. Here it is important to remember that correlation and causation are distinct."
