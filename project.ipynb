    "### Introduction to the project\n",
    "This project investigates the relationship between air pollution levels and various health outcomes across cities in the United States. By combining ambient air quality data from the World Health Organization (WHO) with health statistics from the CDC's PLACES dataset, the analysis examines whether there are statistically significant correlations between air pollutants (particularly PM2.5 and PM10) and the prevalence of various health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "The analysis addresses two primary hypotheses:\n",
    "1. Prevelance of respiratory tract conditions have statistically significant positive correlation with air pollutants.\n",
    "2. Overall quality of life metrics have statistically significant negative correlation with air pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "The analysis employs weighted Spearman correlation coefficients to account for non-normally distributed data and different population sizes across cities. Through comprehensive data processing, statistical testing, and visualization techniques, the project offers insights into how air pollution may be associated with specific health conditions in urban environments."

For this reason, we wanted to include current smoking among adults in the results, since at least in within the scope of our data it seemed to negatively correlate with air pollution levels, and as a known predictor for cancer it could partially explain the result. Hence it could be one hidden variable contributing to this correlation, but the scope of this analysis isn't wide enough to make any conclusions for that. Here it is important to remember that correlation and causation are distinct.\n",
